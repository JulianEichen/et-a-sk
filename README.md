# et-a-sk
Etch-A-Sketch project from theOdinProject:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

Task (extract):
-Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
  ->Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!

-Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. 

-Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

Added features:
- Toggle borders between squares
- Drop-down menu to chose between colors
